## Append Mode

Write mode has some unusual behavior. Writing to a non-existent file creates the file. Writing to an already existing file erases the previous contents of the file. The append mode will also create a file if one does not already exist. However, append mode will not erase content already saved to the file. It will add the text to the end of the file. Run this code and look at the output.

```python
import os

path = "student_folder/text"

output_file = open(os.path.join(path, "practice3.txt"), "w")
output_file.writelines("First sentence")
output_file.close()
```

{try it}(python3 code/files/append.py 1)
[Open practice1.txt](open_preview student_folder/text/practice3.txt)

Now append the following text to the file.

```python
import os

path = "student_folder/text"

output_file = open(os.path.join(path, "practice3.txt"), "a")
output_file.writelines("Second sentence")
output_file.close()
```

{try it}(python3 code/files/append.py 2)
[Open practice1.txt](open_preview student_folder/text/practice3.txt)

## What happens if you:
* Change the append text to `writelines("\nSecond sentence")`?
* Change the program to:
```python
import os

path = "student_folder/text"
new_text = ["How many boards\n", "Could the Mongols hoard\n", "If the Mongols hordes got bored?"]

output_file = open(os.path.join(path, "practice3.txt"), "a")
output_file.writelines(new_text)
output_file.close()
```

[Open practice1.txt](open_preview student_folder/text/practice3.txt)

## With Open

Opening and closing files is an important part of working with files, but it can be tedious to perform both steps. The `with open` command combines the two lines of code. Once the end of the indented code is reached, the file is automatically closed.

```python
import os

path = "student_folder/text"

with open(os.path.join(path, "practice3.txt"), "a") as output_file:
    output_file.writelines("Some new text!")
```

{try it}(python3 code/files/append.py 4)
[Open practice1.txt](open_preview student_folder/text/practice3.txt)

## What happens if you:
* Change the text in `writelines()` to `"\nSome new text!"`?
* Change the program to:
```python
import os

path = "student_folder/text"

with open(os.path.join(path, "practice3.txt"), "a") as output_file:
    output_file.writelines("\nSome new text!")
    output_file.writelines("\nAnd some more text!")
    output_file.writelines("\nYet even more text!")
```
