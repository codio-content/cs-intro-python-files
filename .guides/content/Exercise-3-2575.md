## Files Exercise 3

**Problem**
Write a program that reads a text file and prints the contents in reverse order.

**Expected Output**
The first two lines of your code **must** look like this:

```python
import sys

test_file = sys.argv[1]
```
This allows for different text files to be sent to your program for testing. **Hint**, to open the file use `with open(test_file, "r"...`. The `TRY IT` button below will send a test file to your program. You should see the following output:

```text
The child still struggled and loaded me with epithets which carried despair to my heart; I grasped his throat to silence him, and in a moment he lay dead at my feet.
‘Frankenstein! you belong then to my enemy—to him towards whom I have sworn eternal revenge; you shall be my first victim.’
‘Hideous monster! Let me go. My papa is a syndic—he is M. Frankenstein—he will punish you. You dare not keep me.’
‘Boy, you will never see your father again; you must come with me.’
He struggled violently. ‘Let me go,’ he cried; ‘monster! Ugly wretch! You wish to eat me and tear me to pieces. You are an ogre. Let me go, or I will tell my papa.’
```

  Unfortunately, the code visualizer does not work with the <code>open</code> command, so it cannot be used for this problem.
