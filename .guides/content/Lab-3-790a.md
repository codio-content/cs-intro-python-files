## Lab 3

The following program will ask the user to enter the name of a superhero and then to enter their superpower. These two pieces of information will be written to the CSV file called `superheroes.csv`. When the user enters `stop` for the superhero name, the program will stop running.

Start by importing the `csv` modules. Open the `superheroes.csv` file in write mode as `output_file`.

```python
import csv

with open("student_folder/csv/superheroes.csv", "w") as output_file:
```

Setup a `csv.writer`, and be sure to set the `lineterminator` to `\n` to avoid the mixed line endings warning. The first row in the CSV file should be headers for each column of data.

```python
    writer = csv.writer(output_file, lineterminator="\n")
    writer.writerow(["Superhero", "Power"])
```

Now is the time to ask the user to input the name of the superhero and their superpower. You should also tell the user how to quit the program.

```python
    print("Enter `stop` to quit the program")
    name = input("Enter the superhero's name: ")
    power = input("Enter their superpower: ")
```

The program should run again and again until the user enters `stop`. Since the for loop runs for a predetermined amount of time, an infinite while loop is a better choice. The stop condition is when `name` is equal to `stop`.

```python
    while True:
```

Now, write a line to the CSV file with `name` and `power`. Then ask the user to enter another superhero name. Be sure to check and if it is equal to `"stop"`. Exit the loop with a `break` statement. Finally, ask the user to enter the superpower.

```python
        writer.writerow([name, power])
        name = input("Enter the superhero's name: ")
        if name == "stop":
            break
        power = input("Enter their superpower: ")
```
