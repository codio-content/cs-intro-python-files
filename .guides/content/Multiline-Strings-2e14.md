## Multiline Strings

Imagine that you want to write the words `Hello` and `there` on separate lines of a file called `practice2.txt`. If the `print` statement writes each string on its own line, the `writelines` should too.

```python
import os

path = "student_folder/text"

output_file = open(os.path.join(path, "practice2.txt"), "w")
output_file.writelines("Hello")
output_file.writelines("there")
output_file.close()
```

<details><summary>**Closing a File**</summary>Closing the file is an important step in working with files. If you forget to close a file, some unpredictable actions may take place. For example, if you open a file with newly written text before closing the file, that text may not be in the file. Be sure that you close all of the files that you open.</details>

[Open practice2.txt](open_preview student_folder/text/practice2.txt)

If you want to have text appear on a new line, then you need to use the newline character (`\n`).

## What happens if you:
* Change the `writelines()` code to:
```python
output_file.writelines("Hello\n")
output_file.writelines("there")
```
* Change the `writelines()` code to:
```python
output_file.writelines("Hello\nthere")
```

## A List of Strings

It is possible to use a list of strings with the `writelines()` method. However, these strings will be written one after another with no space between. If you want spaces, be sure to add them. If you want text to appear on a newline, use `\n`.

```python
import os

path = "student_folder/text"

lines_to_write = ["First sentence.", "Second sentence.", "Third sentence."]
output_file = open(os.path.join(path, "practice2.txt"), "w")
output_file.writelines(lines_to_write)
output_file.close()
```

## What happens if you:
* Change `lines_to_write` to `["First sentence. ", "Second sentence. ", "Third sentence."]`?
* Change `lines_to_write` to `["First sentence.\n", "Second sentence.\n", "Third sentence."]`?
