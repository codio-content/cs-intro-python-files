## Read from One File and Write to Another

It is possible to open a file in read mode and another in write mode. Information can be passed from the reading file to the writing file. Like previous examples, `with open` will be used to open both files at once. The code below will open the file `read_practice` in read mode, create `destination.txt` in write mode, read the lines from the source file, and write these lines to the destination file. 

```python
with open("student_folder/text/read_practice.txt", "r") as source, open("student_folder/text/destination.txt", "w") as dest:
    for line in source.readlines():
        dest.write(line)
```

<details><summary>**`write` vs `writelines`**</summary>In the code above the `write` method is being used to write text to a file. Previously, the method `writelines` was used to write text to a file. What's the difference? `writelines` can accept a single string or a list of strings as shown in previous lessons. `write`, however, can only accept a single string.</details>

## What happens if you:
* Change the for loop to:
```python
for line in source.readlines():
    dest.write(line.upper())
```

* Change the for loop to:
```python
for line in source.readlines():
    line += "\n"
    dest.write(line)
```
