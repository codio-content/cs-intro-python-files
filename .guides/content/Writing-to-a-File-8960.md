## Writing to a File

Once the file is opened, the `writelines()` method is used to write text to the file. Any string of text passed to `writelines()` will appear in the file. Once you are done writing to the file, close the file.

```python
output_file = open("student_folder/text/practice1.txt", "w")
output_file.writelines("Hello there")
output_file.close()
```

{try it}(python3 code/files/writing.py 2)
[Open practice1.txt](open_preview student_folder/text/practice1.txt)

<details>
  <summary><strong>Raw Text</strong></summary>
  When writing to text files, Python outputs raw text. Raw text is the text that appears in a text editor. There is no special formatting or extra information attached to this text. Text in MS Word is not raw text. Raw text files have the extension <code>.txt</code>.
