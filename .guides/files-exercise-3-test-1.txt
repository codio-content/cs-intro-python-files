Nor had I erred in my calculations—nor had I endured in vain.
I at length felt that I was free.
The surcingle hung in ribands from my body.
But the stroke of the pendulum already pressed upon my bosom.
It had divided the serge of the robe.
It had cut through the linen beneath.
Twice again it swung, and a sharp sense of pain shot through every nerve.
But the moment of escape had arrived.
At a wave of my hand my deliverers hurried tumultuously away.
With a steady movement—cautious, sidelong, shrinking, and slow—I slid from the embrace of the bandage and beyond the reach of the scimitar.
For the moment, at least, I was free.
